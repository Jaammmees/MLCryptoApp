#things to do

backtesting
- once model building and data processing done, attempt to backtest and generate

realtime
- once the rest is done, we can start trying to simulate real-time

building model
- actually integrate the optimiser and loss function into the training (i guess is more part of the train model bit too)

data processing
- add options to change column names too if needed.
- make it look nicer 

train model
- make it look nicer
- try to show progress in the window itself,
- actually integrate the optimiser and loss function into the training (i guess is more part of the train model bit too) - from building model
